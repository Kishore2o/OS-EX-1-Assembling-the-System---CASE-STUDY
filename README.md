## STEP 4:

A CPU socket uses a series Of pins to connect a CPU’s processor to the Pc’s motherboard. If a CPU is connected via a CPU socket.


## STEP 5:

Heat sink and fan assembly : A HeatSink And Fan (HSF) Is An Active Cooling Solution Used To Cool Down Integrated Circuits In Computer Systems, Commonly The Central Processing Unit (CPU).

## STEP 6:
